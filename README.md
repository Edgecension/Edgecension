A resourceful small business owner of a knife-making start up seeking to bring meticulous, aspirational and entrepreneurial spirit into the realms of information technology and cybersecurity. Proven ability to manage projects in a timely manner with positive results and a strong commitment to quality and innovation.

## Objective
After completing the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate course and an accelerated cybersecurity training curriculum from Per Scholas, it has led me to develop a passion for IT and cybersecurity. I'm eager to transition into this field, aiming for an internship or an entry-level role.
