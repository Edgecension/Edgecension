A motivated individual with aspirations and commitment in achieving personal and professional goals with a relentless drive combined with a warm, personable nature.

## Objective
After completing the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate course and an accelerated cybersecurity training curriculum from Per Scholas, it has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity. Now I'm eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst.
